"""Build conflict graph from scanned mods and produce a recommended load order.

Rules:
- Lower priority value loads first; higher value loads later (sits on top of the chain).
- A mod that overrides function F WITHOUT calling super() breaks the chain — any
  earlier mod's version of F is invisible.
- Therefore: if mod A overrides F without super, and mod B overrides F WITH super,
  B must load AFTER A (B gets higher priority value). Otherwise B is silently lost.
- Two mods both overriding F without super = conflict. Severity depends on how
  much of each mod is broken when it loses (see _consequence below).
- A mod using take_over_path() on res://Scripts/X.gd fully replaces that script
  at runtime. Any mod extending X via `extends` must load AFTER the takeover mod
  or it will inherit from the wrong (vanilla) version. Two takeovers on the same
  base is a hard conflict — only the highest-priority one sticks.
